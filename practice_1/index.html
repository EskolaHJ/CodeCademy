                Not much because this is fandom! So here is what I think. Loki was an outcast to his family of <em>Frost Giants</em>! They sought to abandon him <br>
                in the process of doing so Odin and the aesir invaded. Odin being the "Quote: <strong>God of War</strong>" sought to slay all the <bold><em>Frost Giants</em></bold><br>
                found that they were more formitable than first thought. While inside the frost palace he found the young Loki! Taking pitty while falling back he took the young<br>
                giant under his wing and raised him as his own! Years later Loki grew into his own powers not of the liniage of ancestors but of magics. He played tricks on the<br>

            <h3>Loki's roll</h3>

            <p>
                
                Surprisingly Loki holds a giant roll with in the nore lore. He is the cause for the end and rebirth of the cycle. Through his killing of <strong>Bauldr</strong> which sparks ragnarock.<br>
                With the death of Baldur loki finds himself in trouble with the gods. Where Odin tasks him going to his daughter <strong><em>Hel</em></strong> to retreave the soul of Baldur!
                While doing so Fenrir and Jormungundr and the Frost giants invade Asguard where Odin is slain by Fenrir and Jormungundr is slain by Thor while also being struck down himself.
